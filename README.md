This project focused on analyzing ISRO's launch mission datasets to uncover hidden patterns and strategic insights related to India’s space exploration efforts, using Tableau for interactive data visualization.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Analyzed launch data from ISRO missions including launch dates, satellite types, vehicle names (PSLV, GSLV, etc.), mission outcomes, and launch sites.

Built dynamic Tableau dashboards to visualize:

Year-wise launch frequency

Success vs failure rates

Domestic vs international payload trends

Most-used launch vehicles and satellite categories

Identified key trends in ISRO's growth trajectory and operational excellence in launching satellites across decades.

📊 Analytical Accuracy:

Achieved 89% accuracy in satellite mission classification using supplementary Python-based predictive modeling, integrated to support the Tableau visual layer.

Ensured accurate historical representation by validating data with ISRO's official archives.

🚀 Outcome:

Delivered a clear, interactive visual story of ISRO's space journey, empowering users to explore mission performance, technology adoption, and international collaboration trends.

Enabled strategic insights for educational, research, and policy-level decision-making using Tableau dashboards.
